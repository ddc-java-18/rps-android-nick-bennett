      //     arithmetic. For example, you might use (float) getHeight() / terrain.length.
      //  4. Assign the division result to the variable.

      // TODO Iterate over all of the rows and columns of terrain, using a traditional for loop
      //  (that is, with a row index and a column index). For each element, use canvas.drawOval to
      //  draw an oval for the current element of terrain.

      //    size (above) and (1 + column index); that is, the x coordinate of the right side of the
      //    oval is the same as the x coordinate of the left side of any oval in the next column to
      //    the right.
      //  - The y coordinate of the top of the oval can be computed by multiplying the oval size
      //    (above) and the current row index.
      //  - The y coordinate of the bottom of the oval can be computed by multiplying the oval size
      //    (above) and (1 + row index); that is, the y coordinate of the right side of the oval
      //    is the same as the y coordinate of the top of any oval in the next row down.

      //    corresponding to the terrain element value. For example, if the value of terrain at the
      //    current row and column index positions is 5, you would use the Paint instance found in
      //    breedPaints[5]).

      // TODO STRETCH GOAL: If the computed size of each oval is less than a threshold size of 20,

      //  WITHOUT including an if statement inside the loop. (Hint: Think about a lambda.)
